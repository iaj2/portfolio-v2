# Portfolio Website Version 2

My portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, Sass, and Firebase.

Features:
- Sections on my skills, experiences, interests, and projects.
- Desktop and mobile responsive.
- Dark/ light mode toggle.
- Beautiful UI (I'm bias)
- An admin page where I can manage content updates for projects displayed on the site.
